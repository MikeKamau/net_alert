PURPOSE
==========
This is a simple bash script to alert the user, when the network connection goes down.
The script in this case plays a specific mp3 file, in my case "pekee.mp3" as a notification warning, just place the mp3 file you want in the same directory as the script and either rename it as pekee.mp3 or edit the script to suit your needs.


PREREQUISITES
============
The prerequisites are pretty simple, you just have to have bash and vlc installed.
Alternatively you can use any media player you prefer and just edit the line that invokes vlc.

USE
==========
Feel free to use and modify the script to your heart's content.
